 --2. Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played

 --3. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?-

 --4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.-
 
 SELECT count(po) AS putout1,
           CASE WHEN pos ='OF'THEN 'Outfield'
		        WHEN pos ='SS'OR pos = '1B' OR pos = '2B' OR pos = '3B' THEN 'INfield'
	            WHEN pos = 'P'OR pos = 'C' THEN 'Battery'ELSE 'Ignore' END AS spot
 FROM fielding
 WHERE yearid = '2016'	
 GROUP BY spot;

--6. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where __success__ is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful.(A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted _at least_ 20 stolen bases. 
 
WITH sb_success_attempt	AS
		 (SELECT playerid,(SUM(sb::numeric+cs::numeric)) AS sb_attempt,
			 			 ROUND((SUM(sb::numeric)/SUM(sb::numeric +cs::numeric))*100,2) AS percentage_sb_success
 			FROM batting
 			WHERE yearid = '2016' AND sb >= 20
 			GROUP BY playerid,sb,cs)
 SELECT namefirst,namelast,sb_attempt,percentage_sb_success
 FROM people
	 INNER JOIN sb_success_attempt
 	 USING (playerid)
 ORDER BY percentage_sb_success DESC;
